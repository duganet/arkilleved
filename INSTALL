Arkilloid Level Editor Compilation Guide.

Linux:

	UPDATE TO LATEST DEVELOPMENT VERSION
		First you may want to update your current copy with the recent version in repository.
		You need a nice tool called "git" for it
		Just type:
		
			$ git pull
		
		and it should update everything in the tree.
		If you don't have initialized git repository you can initialize it now:
		
			$ git clone git://git.duganet.ru:arkilloid.git
		
		You're now ready to compile! :)
	
	COMPILING
		First of all chdir to the Level Editor root directory:
		
			$ cd ./arkilloid/tools/arkilloid-leveledit/
		
		Then you need to generate a configure script.
		You'd probably prefer to use provided script to do this:
		
			$ ./autogen.sh
		
		Then you need to configure environment variables and makefiles for your system.
		Run:
		
			$ ./configure
		
		Now it's time to compile and get the binary :)
		
			$ make
		
		Then you may wan't to install binaries and other resource files to your prefix (see below)
		
			$ make install
		
		By default this command will copy all needed files to /usr/local directory.
		You may need root privilegies to do this action. If you have sudo on your system you can use it to run install command:
		
			$ sudo make install
		
		If you need other dir please run
		
			$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/prefix
		
		where /path/to/prefix is path where you want to store application files.
		
		That's all! Now you may run the program typing:
		
			$ arkilloid-leveledit
		
		Good Luck!
